## Step 4: Create Storage Folder

1. Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)
2. Create a new folder for your game files (e.g., "MoodysGames")
3. Right-click the folder â†’ "Share"
4. Set sharing to "Anyone with the link can view"
5. Copy the folder ID from the URL (the long string after `/folders/`)

## Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your deployment platform (Render, Vercel, etc.):

```env
GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your_folder_id_here
```

**Example**:
```env
GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY=AIzaSyBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1BxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxB
```

## Step 6: Deploy Your Application

1. Push your code to your Git repository
2. Deploy to your hosting platform (Render, Railway, etc.)
3. Set the environment variables in your hosting platform's dashboard
4. Your game hosting platform is now ready with **free 15GB storage**!
